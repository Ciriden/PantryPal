Repo for CEG 4110 Project

We plan on making a user friendly website that allows people to manage recipies and their ingredients.

Our priorities are the following:

1. Create/manage/delete recipes
    - Separate recipes into steps that include a value for amount, unit for measuring, and ingredient name
    - Options for allergies and substitutions
    - Servings (with scalability)
    - Prep time with a built in timer for cooking time
2. Pantry
    - An inventory of all foods/ingredients that will react dynamically when making a recipe and buying new ingredients from the shopping cart
    - Categorized into food types
3. Shopping Cart
    - auto generate ingredients used when following a recipe with an option for a user to manually add items
4. Minimalistic design
    - More images than text
    - designed for everyday people, not master chefs
5. Accounts
    - Save user made recipes to a users account
6. Stretch Goals
    - Expand on socials
    - Recipes can be shared
    - rate other user's recipes
