    </ul>

    <h3>Core Features</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Recipe Creation & Management: Users can create, manage, edit, and delete recipes, with step-by-step instructions, ingredient amounts and units, and prep/cooking timers.</li>
  <li>Allergen Tracking: Include allergens for each recipe and ingredient, with alerts for users when allergens are present.</li>
  <li>Shopping Cart & Pantry: Auto-generate shopping carts from recipes, with manual editing options. Items in the cart can be added to the pantry inventory, which dynamically updates as users add/remove ingredients.</li>
  <li>Recipe Scaling: Users can adjust recipe servings and ingredients accordingly.</li>
  <li>Ingredient Substitutions: Suggest substitutions based on availability or dietary preferences.</li>
  <li>Visual Design: Focus on minimalist design with a visual-first approach (more images, less text). Homepage should be simple with a 3-part layout.</li>
  <li>Accessibility: Include accessibility features to accommodate different user needs.</li>
  <li>Customizable Photos: Users can upload custom images for recipes and ingredients.</li>
  <li>User Authentication: Login system with username/password for secure access.</li>
  <li>Privacy Settings: Users can set privacy preferences for sharing recipes and other content.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Stretch Goals</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Social Features: Ability to rate, comment, and share recipes with others, along with future exploration of additional social capabilities.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Other Considerations</h3>
<ul>
  <li>No expiration dates for ingredients in recipes.</li>
  <li>Tracking of cooking time and task completion within the app.</li>
  <li>QR codes for ingredient packaging or recipe sharing may be considered.</li>
  <li>Target Audience: Everyday home users needing an intuitive, easy-to-use solution for recipe and grocery management.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Design & Functionality Notes</h3>
<ul>
  <li>The application should have a clean, simple, and minimalist design with a strong visual focus. The target audience is home users who need a straightforward tool to manage recipes, ingredients, and shopping lists.</li>
</ul>
